# pwnloris-node

**A modern, powerful and optimized Node.js version of the Slowloris attack (with Slow POST support).**

Complete rewrite of the original Python pwnloris tool, designed to be more efficient, stable, and harder to detect.

---

## ✨ Features

- Pure Node.js (no heavy dependencies)
- Hybrid **Slowloris + Slow POST** attack
- Cluster mode – Fully utilizes multi-core CPUs
- Fragmented headers + randomized trickle (stealthier)
- Clean shutdown with Ctrl+C
- Real-time statistics
- Very low RAM usage per connection
- Optimized to bypass Nginx / Cloudflare protections (within limits of single or multiple IPs)

## 📊 Real Performance

| Machine                        | Workers | Connections per Worker | Total Connections     |
|--------------------------------|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| VPS 16 cores / 64GB RAM        | 16      | 800                    | ~12,000 – 13,500      |
| Dev Machine (Residential IP)   | 5       | 250                    | ~1,000 – 1,300        |

**Total with 2 IPs**: Approximately **13,000 – 15,000 concurrent connections**.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoflSecurity/pwnloris-node.git
cd pwnloris-node
2. Quick Start
On a powerful VPS:
Bashulimit -n 65535
node --max-old-space-size=32768 pwnloris.js target.com -c 800 --workers 16
On a dev machine / residential IP:
Bashulimit -n 16384
node --max-old-space-size=4096 pwnloris.js target.com -c 250 --workers 5

```

## Available Options

-c <number> → Connections per worker (default: 1200)
--workers <number> → Number of workers (recommended: number of CPU cores)
--https → Use HTTPS (port 443 by default)

Full example:
```
Bashnode pwnloris.js example.com -c 700 --workers 12 --https
```
Using pm2:
```
ulimit -n 65535 && pm2 start pwnloris.js \
  --name "pwnloris-vps" \
  --node-args="--max-old-space-size=32768" \
  -- \
  ur.mom -c 750 --workers 14
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

This tool is for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only.
Attacking websites without explicit permission is illegal and may result in legal consequences.
Use on residential connections (e.g. your mom's IP) must remain very moderate to avoid saturating the home router.
Cloudflare and modern WAFs significantly limit the effectiveness of single-IP attacks.


## 📌 Best Practices

Run in short bursts of 3 to 5 minutes, then pause for 30–60 seconds before restarting.
Using multiple IPs (VPS + residential) greatly increases the impact.
Always monitor system resources with free -h and htop.
